# Tabular_Data_Science
final project in the course Tabular Data Science  by Dr. Amit Somech in Bar-Ilan University

# Installation
Clone this project, Make sure that the Data and utils folders are in the same directory as the script.

no need to run a requirements file, I used only libaries we saw in class (and mpl_toolkits which comes with matplotlib that we saw in class).

if needed there is a list of the libaries I used in the file LibrariesList.txt

# run project
run the Jupyter Notebook:
